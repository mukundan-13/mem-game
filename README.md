### Memory game

I have did a interactive memory game using Html,css,and JavaScript.
In this game,we have to select two cards,if they are found to be same our points will rise and the cards will unflip.
The challenge in this game is,the cards will be hidden and also a timer will be running.We should choose correct cards in minimum amount of moves and within the timer ends.
